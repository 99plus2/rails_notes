# Showing the slides

We use a Ruby app called `showoff` to generate and serve the slides.

Alex has been improving showoff; until his latest patches get accepted and released, you will have to download and install his version, as follows:

    git clone git://github.com/alexch/showoff.git
    cd showoff
    bundle install --without optional
    rake gem:install
    
After installing, run

    showoff serve

This will launch a local Sinatra server on port 9090. Open your browser to `localhost:9090`. On a Mac you can run:

    open http://localhost:9090

Use arrow keys to navigate slides. Press '?' to see a help window.

# Editing slides

Slides are in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) format. Showoff will read all `.md` files in alphabetical order.

You can also add custom `.css`, `.scss`, and `.js` files, which will get imported into all slide sections.

Images should be in, or relative to, the current directory.

# Printing slides

Try this: first `gem install pdfkit`, then visit

    http://localhost:9090/pdf

but I make no guarantees!
